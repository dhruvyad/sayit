</p>

```bash
saynow "the build finished, 42 tests passed"
```

It speaks, and shows a bubble in the corner with the transcript lit word by
word — so a sentence you half-heard is still readable. Works with no
configuration, falling back to your OS's built-in voice: offline, free, no key.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g saynow     # Node >= 18
pip install saynow        # Python >= 3.9
```

Same CLI, same config file, zero dependencies either way. On macOS the
[settings app](#settings-app) builds in the background afterwards and appears a
few seconds later — the install itself never waits for it. `SAYNOW_NO_APP=1`
skips it. To try saynow without installing: `npx saynow "hello"`.

## Ask, and wait for the answer

```bash
answer=$(saynow --ask "Should I drop the old table?")
```

Speaks, shows a reply box, and blocks. The reply goes to stdout. Exit `0` means
they answered, exit `2` means nobody was there — so an agent can tell "they said
no" from "they were away from the desk".

## Usage

```bash
saynow "text to speak"                    # speak an argument
echo "text" | saynow                      # speak stdin
npm test 2>&1 | tail -1 | saynow          # speak a command's last line
saynow --from "ci · deploy" "shipped"     # name the sender in the header
saynow --file report.md "numbers are up"  # show a document, say one line
saynow -p openrouter -v Kore "hi"         # pick a provider and voice
saynow --no-ui "hello"                    # speak without the bubble
saynow --save note.mp3 "hello"            # write a file instead of playing
```

`saynow --help` lists every flag, and `man saynow` is the same as a man page.

| Provider | Quality | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `system` | Fair | Nothing — built into the OS |
| `openai` | Good | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `elevenlabs` | Best | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | **Best** | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — 15 speech models, 245 voices |

Long text is rendered a sentence at a time, so a full article starts speaking
in about three seconds rather than after the whole thing is synthesised.

If a provider is configured but its key is missing, saynow warns on stderr and
speaks with the system voice anyway: an agent reporting "done" to someone who
heard nothing is worse than a robotic voice. `--strict` opts out. Concurrent
calls are serialized machine-wide, so three agents produce three sentences
rather than one muddle.

## Show a document

```bash
saynow --file report.md --ask "Weekly numbers are up. Anything look wrong?"
```

`--file` renders Markdown in the bubble — headings, lists, tables, quotes,
code, links and images, local or remote. The text argument becomes the only
thing spoken, which is what a long report usually wants.

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhruvyad/saynow/main/docs/document.png" alt="a Markdown report rendered in the bubble, with a chart" width="420">
</p>

Relative image paths resolve against the document's own directory, so a folder
holding the report and its charts works as-is. The bubble stays open while you
hover, scroll or type in it, so a document is read at your pace rather than a
timer's.

Documents are escaped before rendering and only tags saynow builds itself are
emitted, so one cannot script the bubble.

## Keep what you synthesised

Reading a long article costs money and seconds, so every cloud synthesis is
archived with its duration and what it cost:

```bash
saynow history            # newest first
saynow history open 3     # play one back
saynow history path       # to share a file from it
```

The newest 50 are kept — `saynow config set historyLimit <n>`, or `0` for none.

## Settings app

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhruvyad/saynow/main/docs/app.png" alt="the saynow settings app" width="620">
</p>

macOS only, installed alongside the CLI. Picks a model from the live catalogue
with prices, stores keys, and browses, plays and prices the archive. It compiles
from source during install, so it needs the Xcode command line tools
(`xcode-select --install`); without them the install skips it and says so, and
`saynow app install` adds it later.

It is a separate process from the CLI — they meet only at
`~/.config/saynow/config.json`, so either works without the other.

## Use it from an agent

For Claude Code, install the plugin — it ships a skill that teaches Claude when
to speak, so you do not have to explain it in every project:

```
/plugin marketplace add dhruvyad/saynow
/plugin install saynow@saynow
```

Otherwise add this to your `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or equivalent:

```markdown
Speak to the user with `saynow --from "<who> · <task>" --ask "<text>"`. It
shows a reply box and prints their answer to stdout; exit 2 means they were
away, which is never consent. Default to `--ask` — almost anything worth
saying invites a reply. Use `--file report.md` when the answer is a table or a
chart. Keep it to one short sentence: it is heard, not read, and `--from`
means you never have to introduce yourself. Do not narrate routine progress.
```

## How the bubble works

On macOS it is a borderless `NSPanel` hosting a `WKWebView`: no Dock icon, no
entry in the app switcher, and it never steals focus. It compiles from
[`shell/SaynowPanel.swift`](shell/SaynowPanel.swift) on first use and caches the
binary — **about 84 KB**, because it borrows the system WebKit instead of
shipping a browser. Elsewhere it falls back to a Chromium app window loading the
identical page, and with neither available saynow just speaks.

All of the bubble is one file, [`ui/bubble.html`](ui/bubble.html).

## Reference

```bash
saynow --help    # every flag, setting and exit code
man saynow       # the same, as a man page
```

Both render from a single [`help.txt`](help.txt) shared by the npm and pip
builds, and CI fails if they ever disagree.
